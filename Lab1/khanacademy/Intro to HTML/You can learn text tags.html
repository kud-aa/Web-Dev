            <strong><em>Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>Thankfully, we are born to learn.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>Until one day, you walk.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>This. is. learning.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>It’s not that you don’t get it. </em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>You just don’t get it,</em></strong> yet.
            <strong><em>Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.</em></strong><br>
            <strong><em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em></strong><br>
